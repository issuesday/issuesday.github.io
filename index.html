					<h2>About Issues Day</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Issues Day is an annual Saint Mary’s Hall tradition put on by the Junior Class Issues Day Committee of an in-depth discussion of an intellectual and timely topic. Open and direct study of difficult subjects provides a wonderful opportunity to the students and faculty of our school, encouraging dialogue on the toughest questions of our time. The event shows respect for our students’ intellect and maturity while highlighting our faculty’s professionalism and abilities in working with our students to help them develop their own beliefs and opinions regarding difficult topics. As in the past, this year’s topic is not one which yields an easy answer or simple consensus. However, our students’ active participation will help them view opposing opinions as they solidify their own thoughts and beliefs. We are encouraging our community to examine the topic with openness and respect for self and others, and with gratitude to our esteemed speakers who have donated their time to further our understanding of this topic.  This year’s discussion focuses on the relationship between privacy and national security, an increasingly prominent issue in our time, and will investigate surveillance policy and practices, and our society’s approach to these now and in the near future.
